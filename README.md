Temporary Username and Password Generator (Leran Python Codecademy Project 1/24/2022)

Program that generates a username and password. It's a basic structure that uses some builtin functions like len() along with lists as the data structure 
and strings as the data type. I utilized range indexing for string splicing.

The program is fairly straightforward but I would like to come back and build it out further byt incorporating regex where applicable, refactor to reduce the code, 
maybe using list comprehension for ease of readability. Lambda Expressions for the simple conditionals because I like one liners where I can get away wth it.
I want to connect to a database for the first/last name retrieval (probably MySQL to start). This would make the program useful in an employment setting (as in HR).
I would run it in Flask as the microframework since it's small and Jinja2 as the template engine, specifically for variable substitution to import user input as
the function arrguments.

I'm running the program in VS Code using PIPENV to establish my virtual environment. Im excited to exmand this into a full-stack program that could be incorporated 
into a larger environment.
